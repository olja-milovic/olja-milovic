# Hi, I'm Olja. Nice to meet you!

I am a frontend developer and a design enthusiast with a desire to create engaging apps, creative solutions and immersive web experiences. The technologies I enjoy working with include primarily **Angular** and **React.js** (**JavaScript**). Although my main focus is on frontend, I have a solid knowledge of backend as well, having worked on **Python** and **Node.js** services.

These days I'm focused on the artistic side of creating web apps. As much as I've always been interested in arts and illustrations, I have to admit I haven't taken enough time to grow in that direction, but I know that will change soon.

_**Also, here's my illustrated cat Lili for no reason**_:
